Algorithm: Doubly Linked List

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Create a node structure with data, prev, and next pointers

Step 3: To insert at beginning:
        - Create new node
        - Set new node's next to head
        - Set new node's prev to NULL
        - If head is not NULL, set head's prev to new node
        - Update head to new node

Step 4: To insert at end:
        - Create new node
        - Set new node's next to NULL
        - If list is empty, set new node's prev to NULL and head to new node
        - Else, traverse to last node, set last node's next to new node, and new node's prev to last node

Step 5: To delete a node:
        - Search for node with given value
        - If found, update previous node's next and next node's prev
        - If node is head, update head to next node
        - Free the node

Step 6: To display list:
        - Traverse from head and print each node's data

Step 7: Repeat operations as per user choice
