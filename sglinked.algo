Algorithm: Singly Linked List

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Create a node structure with data and next pointer

Step 3: To insert at beginning:
        - Create new node
        - Set new node's next to head
        - Update head to new node

Step 4: To insert at end:
        - Create new node
        - If list is empty, set head to new node
        - Else, traverse to last node and set its next to new node

Step 5: To delete a node:
        - Search for node with given value
        - If found, remove node and update links

Step 6: To display list:
        - Traverse from head and print each node's data

Step 7: Repeat operations as per user choice

Step 8: Stop
