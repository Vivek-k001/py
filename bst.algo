Algorithm: Binary Search Tree (BST)

Step 1: Start

Step 2: Create a node structure with data, left, and right pointers

Step 3: To insert a value:
        - If tree is empty, create root node
        - Else, find correct position and insert left or right

Step 4: To search a value:
        - Start from root and move left or right based on value

Step 5: To delete a value:
        - Find the node
        - If node has no child, remove it
        - If node has one child, replace with child
        - If node has two children, replace with smallest in right subtree

Step 6: For traversals:
        - Inorder: left, root, right
        - Preorder: root, left, right
        - Postorder: left, right, root

Step 7: Repeat operations as per user choice

Step 8: Stop
