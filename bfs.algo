Algorithm: BFS Traversal

1. Start
2. Read number of vertices n
3. Read the adjacency matrix
4. Read the starting vertex
5. Mark the starting vertex as visited
6. Insert the starting vertex into the queue
7. While the queue is not empty:
      a. Remove the front element (node)
      b. Print node
      c. For each vertex i:
             If node is connected to i AND i is not visited:
                    Mark i as visited
                    Add i to the queue
8. Stop
