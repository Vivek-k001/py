Step 3: To insert at beginning:
        - Create new node
        - Set new node's next to head
        - Update head to new node

Step 4: To insert at end:
        - Traverse to last node
        - Create new node
        - Set last node's next to new node

Step 5: To delete a node:
        - Search for node with given value
        - Remove node and update links

Step 6: To display list:
        - Traverse from head and print each node's data
